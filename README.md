   - Keep reusable components in the `components` folder.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use `.env` files to store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive and mobile-first design.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling in both the frontend and backend.
